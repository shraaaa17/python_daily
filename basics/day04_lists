Day 4 - Lists Practice
Author: Shravani
Topic: Lists and List Operations
Description: Practice creating and manipulating lists.
"""

# Creating a list
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print("Original List:", numbers)

# Accessing elements
print("First element:", numbers[0])
print("Last element:", numbers[-1])

# Adding elements
numbers.append(60)
print("After append:", numbers)

# Removing elements
numbers.remove(20)
print("After removing 20:", numbers)

# List slicing
print("First three elements:", numbers[:3])

# Looping through list
print("All elements:")
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

# List operations
print("Sum:", sum(numbers))
print("Maximum:", max(numbers))
print("Minimum:", min(numbers))

# Day 4 – Lists

## Concepts Learned
- Creating lists
- Indexing and slicing
- append() and remove()
- Looping through lists
- Built-in functions like sum(), max(), min()

## Reflection
Today I practiced manipulating lists, which are fundamental for data structures and algorithms.
